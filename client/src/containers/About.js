              The process of animal rescue adoption has many steps, and each
              one, while necessary, is a speed bump on road between the animal
              and its new forever home. Checking the home of the potential
              adopter is one of the bigger hurdles.
            </p>
            <p>
              HomeChecker allows the volunteer (checker) to assess, fill out a
              form, and send the form to the adoption agency within minutes of
              the visit. It saves time and resources in two ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In lieu of printing out the survey for the visit and entering
                the checker's notes afterward, the survey is saved as a PDF and
                then sent by email or text to the adoption agency.
              </li>
              <li>
                HomeChecker also allows the checker to have the potential
                adopters' information (address and mobile) at the ready so that
                information is at hand and not lost in a sea of emails.
              </li>
            </ul>

              adoption groups in Queensland, Australia, and in Texas, USA.
              Currently, her house is full, so she helps by doing home checks
              and fixing this part of the process.
